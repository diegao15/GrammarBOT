<h1>STEP BY STEP</h1>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Community 2017</li>
<p>First of all you need to have installed Visual Studio 2017 Community(Free)
<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/downloads/">(https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/downloads/)</a> on your computer.</p>

<li>Registration</li>
<p>Then you need to subimit your email on https://www.grammarbot.io/signup to receive your API_KEY wich one will be used for all the calls
from your application to the API.</p>

<li>Create Project</li>
<p>After install Visual Studio 2017 Community you will need to create a new project , you can choose what Platform to work, on that example
i used a simple Windows Form Application.</p>

<li>Understanding JSON</li> 
<p>All the API calls that we are going to make use a simple text format to transport all that information, that format is called JSON,
but we cannot simply get that response from the server and show to the user, we have to process and make that information useful to
the program, so after create a class from that response, i used Newtonsoft.Json to transform that text response on the object that i need
to work, you just need to go on Nuget Package managment and search for Newtonsoft.Json install and start to use it after declare 
using Newtonsoft.Json on your C# file header;</p>

<li>Source Code</li>
<p>The project that im going to share with you guys have a class with a simple way to implement that calls using an async task and that 
Package, fell free to download it and make it better.</p>

<li>Using<lli>
<p>To call that API you just need to have three parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>First one is the API_KEY that you get from the SIGNUP https://www.grammarbot.io/signup</li>
<li>Second one is the sentence that you want to check</li>
<li>And Third is the language you are going to check: "en-US"</li>
<ol>

<li>Conclusion</li>
<p>After send that call to the WEb servie you will get a lot of info on the response, but, the Typos suggestions will come on "Matchs" arrays
as you guys can see on the example.</p>
</ul>
